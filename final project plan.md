5. **Plan A**

    1. What are you interested in this topic:

        I am interested in how to implement neural networks to solve problems in computer vision.

    2. How hard do you think it will be and why:

        I think it depends on which neural network I am going to use and what problem I am going to solve. I've found a data set containing a brain MRI dataset and it only contains data from 110 patients. It is a small dataset and the goal is to delineate the region of brain tumor, which is a binary classification problem. The neural network I am going to use is UNet, which is pretty small and easy to train. Thus, I think it won't be too complicated.

    3. What will you need to learn to complete the project?

        First, I need to learn how to process images and how to enhance the image with libraries including torchvision. Then I need to be familiar with the PyTorch library. I need to learn how to build a customized U-net class and determine the loss function, optimization method, forward function, etc. I also need to determine how am I going to present my result. 

    4. What will be my first step to getting started?

        I am going to start with the torchvision and PyTorch libraries. 

    5. What are the biggest cons and pros?

        The biggest advantage is that I am going to be familiar with the PyTorch framework by doing this project. The biggest disadvantage is that it might need a GPU to run and I don't have one. Thus I am going to use google collab to train my model. 

    **Plan B**

    1. What are you interested in this topic:

        I am interested in how to use python to do web scraper.

    2. How hard do you think it will be and why:

        I think it will be not too complicated. But it does need some time for me to learn because I've never done anything similar to it. 

    3. What will you need to learn to complete the project?

        I need to learn some basic knowledge of HTTP protocol and HTML/CSS. 

    4. What will be my first step to getting started?

         I will start with some video teaching how to do web scraper.

    5. What are the biggest cons and pros?

        Pros: the technique is quite useful when we need to prepare some datasets for machine learning.
